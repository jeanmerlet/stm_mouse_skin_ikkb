converting counts to integer mode
  it appears that the last variable in the design formula, 'condition',
  has a factor level, 'control', which is not the reference level. we recommend
  to use factor(...,levels=...) or relevel() to set this as the reference level
  before proceeding. for more information, please see the 'Note on factor levels'
  in vignette('DESeq2').
